Task 1 – Rule-Based AI Chatbot

This is a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python.  
It responds to user input with predefined replies using simple if-else conditions.


 Problem Statement

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.  
Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.  
This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flo



 Concepts Used

- if-else conditions  
- input/output in Python  
- string matching  
- basic conversation logic


 How to Run

1. Open `chatbot.py` in any Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, Pydroid, etc.)
2. Run the script
3. Type messages like `hello`, `how are you`, `bye`, etc. to interact with the chatbot
4. Type `bye` or `exit` to end the chat
